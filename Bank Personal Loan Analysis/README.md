## Buisness Case :
This case is about the bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore the ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customer (while retaining them as depositor). A campaign that the bank ran last year for the liability customers showed the healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to device campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimum budget.
